### 🚀 Workloads
**Location**: `workloads/`

Different workload types and patterns:
- Deployments and ReplicaSets
- StatefulSets for stateful applications
- DaemonSets for node-level services
- Jobs and CronJobs
- Init containers and lifecycle hooks

**Current Demos**:
- `workload-types-demo.yaml` - Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, and multi-container patterns

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hariscats/The-Yaml-aboratory.git
   cd The-Yaml-aboratory
   ```

2. **Browse demos by category**:
   ```bash
   ls -la resource-management/
   ls -la networking/
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Apply a demo**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f resource-management/pod-cpu-resize-demo.yaml
   ```

4. **Read the documentation**:
   Each demo folder contains its own README with specific instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (version varies by demo)
- `kubectl` CLI configured
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts

Some demos may require:
- Specific Kubernetes versions
- Feature gates enabled
- Additional controllers or operators

## Contributing

Each demo should include:
- ✅ Well-commented YAML manifests
- ✅ README with prerequisites and instructions
- ✅ Real-world use-case explanation
- ✅ Testing and verification steps
- ✅ Cleanup instructions
